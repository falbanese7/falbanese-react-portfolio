This portfolio site is comprised of 4 sections.

## Navbar

There are 4 links to click here: "About Me", "Projects", "Resume", and "Contact". Clicking each of these render the contents of each page individually to the window. The URL in the viewer's browser's web bar will also display the corresponding section.
